						<h2>I knew I was going to move almost immediately after reading of my acceptance into the Cirque du Soleil database.</h2>
						I had been booking events, traveling more for gigs, teaching many hours, and making a considerable side-income with my circus career. Additionally, I’d have to move from Minneapolis, MN if I truly wanted to pursue circus full-time in any capacity. Gigging, teaching, touring, shows... The midwest is good for performing artists, but tougher for circus artists in particular. My two locations of choice were Montreal, QC and Las Vegas, NV.

						Montreal, of course, is where the 10 companies I auditioned for were based, including the Cirque du Soleil HQ. And Las Vegas, NV boasts the most Cirque du Soleil shows of any city. Though I’d been to Montreal and loved it, Vegas was a place I had yet to visit. I was encouraged by a friend who made the move from Minneapolis to Vegas to perform as well, so I decided to visit in September 2019.
						“I’m gonna sell you on Vegas by the time you leave.” she said, smugly. I was unsure – for no certain reason. But I was unsure. We went to see shows, ate excellent food, toured the city. . . She even set me up with a photoshoot while I was there and got me connected with other solid people in the performance industry! I truly owe her a lot.

						Needless to say, I was sold. I did already have friends in Vegas, but I made even more! Especially when I came back to work with a friend on our routine for the San Antonio Spurs’ New Year’s Eve Half-Time show! That was my second trip to Vegas – and it was quick. But I knew the next time I came back, I’d be staying for a while.
						Once I got home, I had four months until my lease was up, and it was time to go. I finished the year strong, had a solid performances and gigs to start the new year, saw all my friends for my last birthday celebration in Minnesota, and. . . Began the drive to Vegas aimed at arriving March 1st! 
						With gigs lined up, friends in the industry, and opportunities everywhere, I was beyond excited to start the next chapter of my adventure. Now, Las Vegas is a lot less blue and green that Minnesota. . . But the mountains and gorgeous weather make it worthwhile.

						Until next time!
